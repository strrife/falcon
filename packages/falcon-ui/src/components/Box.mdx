<H2 my="lg" children="Box" />

`Box` is a simple, generic component that by default renders as `<div>`.
It doesn't ship with default theme, but yet still accepts all of the [responsive, theme-based style props](/responsive-props).
It's very flexible and can be used to quickly prototype new components or create one off components with custom styling needs.

```javascript
import { Box } from '@deity/falcon-ui';
```

<Playground>
  <Box display="grid" gridGap="md">
    <Box fontSize="lg">Generic box component</Box>
    <Box bg="secondaryLight" color="secondaryText" p="xxxl">With background & large padding</Box>
    <Box as="img" size="xxl" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1118933/46464650-2f40df00-c7c7-11e8-827c-576ce330cb06.png" />
  </Box>
