## Introduction

DEITY Falcon is a platform agnostic, stand-alone but modular library to easily build headless PWA websites.

Falcon was built with the **F.I.R.E.** principal in mind:

- Flexible - Allow you to build any kind of website; e-commerce, blogs, portfolio's, you name it
- Integrable - Allow you to integrate any kind of data source with it
- Reliable - You do not have to worry about high traffic and scalability
- Extensible - Allow you to extend your project with as many custom features as necessary

### Why should you use Falcon

- You can work separately and independently on the front or back-end - save crucial development time
- Get started within a couple minutes using our CLI tool `create-falcon-app`
- Client rendering (SPA) to increase pagespeed and reduce server load
- Server Side Rendering (SSR) built-in - no longer do you have to worry about SPA SEO complications
- Service worker to provide application caching and PWA features such as offline capabilities and add to homescreen
- Falcon's architecture allows it to be very modular, lightweight and scalable

These are just a couple of advantages and use-cases, feel free to ask anything in the official slack channel [slack.deity.io](https://slack.deity.io)
